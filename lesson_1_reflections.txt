How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    * you can view changes in code like added and removed lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    *because you can get back in any time point efficiently

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you will be able to decide when to commit based on when you made a logical change
    like : adding new feature, fixing a bug, optimzing something. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    becuase the one logical change that you make in your project might be in different files
    liks : adding button to html file and the style for it in the css

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using git log will show the history of commits form recent to old
    and using git diff will compare two commits and show insertion and deletions happened

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you can checkout to any early commit any time and you can aslo diff commits to see
    what introduced the bugs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i wanna start using git to manage me projects
